# Duke Waiting List Prediction

After painfully coming to terms with being put on the waiting list at my dream school, I began browsing through Duke’s wait-list FAQ’s to see if I could improve my chances in any way. A certain question struck me:

Can you predict how many students will be admitted from the waiting list this year?

Obviously the answer was no, but having recently completed a machine learning course on supervised learning, and with access to Duke’s Common Data Sets, I decided it would be an interesting first application of my newly learnt knowledge to see If I could answer that question, or at least provide a statistically probable answer.

Below is the abstract of the research paper I wrote to do just that. 
In addition, I have attached the entire paper, and the link to the program I wrote to make the prediction is at: https://github.com/jahaanmukhi/Duke-Waiting-List-Prediction.

# ABSTRACT

My algorithm uses a Matrix approach to Multiple Linear Regression to find the relationship between the number of students admitted off the waiting list and two variables, those being the number of students accepted Early Decision and the number accepted Regular decision to Duke University. This relationship was determined using a 3 year analysis of the Class of 2018, 2017 and 2016 admission statistics. After which, on inputting the Early Decision and Regular Decision acceptances for the Class of 2020, the algorithm estimated 61 students being admitted off the waiting list this year.

# I hope to be one of those 61.
